2019 and I am still unsuccesful, no talent and look like potato.

I dont Try To be fake thats Why I am Unsuccesful at most Of the times.

Not a single good thing can happen with me. I can't achieve anything, i can't marry the one i like. I don't have strength for anything

Keep telling myself... I cannot can‚Äôt achieve anything if I don‚Äôt settle

‚ÄúNik, im tired, exhausted, feel useless, useless to myself, im crazy. lifeless, i feel weak, I once tried to comment suicide‚Äù

For many years I allowed my trauma to tell me I was weak. I allowed my trauma to make me feel weak & I believed I was weak. Then one day I realized that I had believed a lie. I had been living a lie.  You can‚Äôt survive rape & be weak. 

when I am weak, love when I feel forsaken, courage when I am afraid, wisdom when I feel foolish, comfort when I am alone, hope when I feel rejected, and peace when I am in turmoil. 

I feel so weak when someone see me cry

if i cry in front of you, im reallu hurting. i absolutely hate crying in front of people. i feel weak, like im begging for sympathy and that‚Äôs not me

Don‚Äôt ever apologize onstage. It makes you look weak. I don‚Äôt care if you just dropped a baby. Don‚Äôt apologize. Making excuses for your lack of preparation makes everyone in the house uncomfortable and feel bad for you. Own the stage. Own the room. Own your set. Or don‚Äôt show up.

I'm so exhausted about everything, i feel really lost and weak but I'm not the type of person whose gonna give up because my mom raise me to be strong and brave at all cost.

I don't forgive people because I'm weak.

I am nothing if not a weak willed human being..

Fuck I‚Äôm so weak today. Why am I like this.

If I can‚Äôt speak about the things that make me sad then I am weak üñ§üñ§

Will I be fine? Will tomorrow be good to me? But tomorrow is uncertain, and that makes me afraid. I am not fine, not tomorrow or any other day. I wish there is no tomorrow.
I hate the feeling of not being in control.

Uncertainty causes stress and not feeling in control can be a big source of burnout. What headteachers could do to instil a sense of control in their staff is reduce ambiguity. So being transparent and sharing decisions.

I‚Äôve been struggling with my thoughts and my feelings. I feel like I‚Äôm no longer in control. Depression sucks. Feeling like you‚Äôre not wanted sucks. Not knowing what to do sucks. All I can say is I‚Äôm sorry.

Idk whether I wanna buy makeup, paint my room or online shop. Idk what I need but i‚Äôm not feeling in control today I dont know

I do know that I should not be doing this.. and that the moment you take my admin status from me and you're in control that I'll have a sudden "instant" regret feeling, followed by a sense of acceptance and defeat..
knowing that doesn't take away the desire to give in and submit

it seemed like part of the experience, to me. I hate the idea of not feeling in control of the situation. I am honestly more scared of the epidural than the birth, so i‚Äôve had 3 unmedicated deliveries.

There is a maddening feeling to realize you‚Äôre walking through the motions, feeling like you‚Äôre not really in control of yourself but falling to the gravity of the easiest familiar path. I look forward to the end of the month & further embracing the new challenging road ahead.

So many reasons, expensive, feeling like a burden or once you do get help you sometimes feel like people think your using it as a crutch. Some don‚Äôt like the idea of possibly needing to take medication for the rest of their lives (not being in control)..

I hate feeling like i‚Äôm not in control

Among the things I hate most: feeling not in control.

I've been sick all week. Have had to cancel 2 trips/talks, more meetings than I can count, and any hope of being productive.

Trying to get past the guilt thing I get every time I'm sick and let myself do nothing. Not easy.

My response to feeling like I‚Äôm not coping or in control is to restrict my eating. I don‚Äôt want to be one of those girls who has to quit uni because of illness but also it‚Äôs so easy at uni to not eat literally nobody notices.

Drifting...

That feeling of helplessness and not being in control...

not being in control of the situation is a terrible feeling

i hate it when suppressed feelings resurface.
i hate it when i'm not in control of the things i use to have control over.
i hate feeling so vulnerable and weak.

i feel like im not in control of my own body im@gonna try to fast to regain the feeling of control uggjfjn

Is the biggest conspiracy that we are made to feel powerless?
SS: I have noticed a growing theme on this sub of people feeling powerless to affect real change in the world. Adam Curtis documentary films like Hypernormalisation, The Power of Nightmares etc suggest that this state of feeling powerless, might be by design, but dont fully develop the idea.

Is the chaotic and seemingly upside down world we live in, made extra chaotic and topsy turvy by 'them' by design? To keep us all in a state of fear or mild panic?

I don't know but IMHO the true power still lies with us not 'them', in our collective consumer decision-making and life choices we can actually positively shape the world around us.

So, in part inspired by today's top post about Google, I thought it would be a good idea to have a post where we could compile a list of actual changes we can all make to manoeuvre nearly a million people on this sub in to a more positive and empowered position. That could have an incredible ripple effect on the actions of millions more around us...

First (and I have no affiliation with this organisation whatsoever - just a long time user) is to swap out Google as your homepage search engine and replace with Ecosia. A quick and easy win - start planting trees while you search and put a tiny dent in Google's profits as you go. Not everyone on here has the land, money or motivation to actually go out and plant a sapling, but everyone on here has a search engine. 60,000,000 trees and counting. Help get Ecosia to a billion and impact real change with minimal effort on your part.

Second, opt out of buying from unethical companies through convenience or price. If you can afford the extra bit of cash for fair trade bananas, buy them. Apply this principle to all your consumer choices. Be an early adopter to disruptive technology that threatens the established corporations, and call out unethical or damaging company practices on social media. Demand they change their ways.

Third, under no circumstances invest in funds that may support the military industrial complex, big oil, big pharma etc. If you have any spare money invest it in companies you trust to be working towards a less conflicted and less oil reliant world. If in doubt invest in crypto.

Got criticized at work and anxiety went through the roof. Feels like losing all my progress and I feel powerless.
Work/School
Work has been complicated. We‚Äôre in a stressful moments and I‚Äôm handling two projects that are not detectou related to my professional knowledge and it‚Äôs starting to show. My boss is very bad at communicating, has his own ideas of how things should go and doesn‚Äôt accept anything that doesn‚Äôt match those, but his ideas change constantly and are very high expectations.

I‚Äôve made a lot of progress with my anxiety since February. First month at my job I was terrified all the time, would get home and cry, had to do breathing exercises at the bathroom to get through the day without crying.

Yesterday my boss was out of office, wouldn‚Äôt answer my messages asking for approval to move forward (had a bunch of people waiting for this), and asked, without telling me, a coworker to intervene, who changed specs of my product without informing me.

I‚Äôve been a mess. Couldn‚Äôt relax at any point during the evening, dreading my whole workday today, and having a lot of trouble focusing/not crying. Boss still won‚Äôt answer when I message him but is communicating with other coworkers. It‚Äôs important to mention that before this project I hadn‚Äôt gotten criticized before and people were happy with me.

Feeling very useless since I break like this at the first sign of stress. I spent months without having problems with my anxiety and thinking I‚Äôm finally in a good place and then this happens, everything comes crashing down on me and i remind myself that feeling like crap is always going to be part of my life, I‚Äôll just manage it so it‚Äôs not like this all the time. Feeling very powerless.

Hi redditors, i just kinda need someone to listen. Im not really feeling like myself. I feel really down and im not sure what to do about it.

I became a mom about a year and a half ago and it has made me a total softie. Since then I've noticed that people just kinda walk all over me. I don't like wasting time on petty arguments and silly fights so i usually just avoid them. They aren't worth my time frankly, i have other things i would rather spend my time doing. Being happy is important to me. But it seems like everyone else just wants to be miserable and drag me down too.

But these past few weeks have made me feel powerless. Men specifically have been talking to me in a way that isnt acceptable. My manager has anger issues and he is now taking them out on me because i guess im an easy target. I find myself wondering what i would do if this happened around my son. Random people (customers) seem to also be looking for a rise out of me too. I dont really think its necessary for specifics but its been several occurances where people verbally attack me unprovoked. Only men though? Speaking to me in a way that if they were speaking to another man the same way,they would be punched. I just dont know why this is happening..

I feel powerless
I'm burying my son on Wednesday.

He was born last thursday, after we found out his heart had stopped 2 days before, in week 19.

Up until now, I have tried to take care of my girlfriend as much as I can and tried to stay strong. I went to work again Monday and done most of the shopping, because she can't bear to be around to many people for too long or even leave the appartment because of the risk of running in to other pregnant women.

But now I can feel that my world is collapsing around me, because I haven't allowed myself to grief in the same way as her. I've had one major breakdown at work and the sound of crying babies when i'm out is heartwrenching.

I don't normally talk about my feelings as i'm kind of introvert, and I've really tried to talk with my girlfriend about this whole situation, but I just can't seem to form the words. I don't know what to do with myself, and I feel powerless.

I this normal or is it just me? Does it get easier with time?

This is how I‚Äã feel when I‚Äã see news like this. I feel powerless sometimes because I do not think I ever will create any positive impact on the world given my personal skillsets and career opportunity. I wish I could put a bullet into people who are ignoring ethics and morals for profit.

Do stoics feel powerless over others and the world?
It might be a misconception but the one I would like to verify.

My mom terrorizes me my grandma and my sister almost every other day. Being nice doesn't help because it's never nice enough or in the right way. Ignoring her just makes her mad and she'll pick fights. Being honest makes her mad. She just yells or cries whenever she knows someone else is right. She keeps escalating in physicality when she fights with my sister. Me ignoring her just makes her take it out on my sister. I don't know what to do. My license is expired as are my tags I'm unemployed.

Death feels like the only way out half the time but I know deep deep deep deep down it's not but in moments like this I can't phathom any other way for my life to be.

I wanted to end things so badly tonight. I just feel nunb rn and I have access to means of harm and she's made me so terrified and hate myself that idk if I can hold up much longer.

She's already told me she had originally planned to abort me but was too lazy to drive to Kansas and then later that I should just go ahead and kill myself.

I just want my mom to love me and admit she's sick but Everytime she just doubles down on the hatred and anger.

I don't know what to do. The cops can't/won't do anything because she hasn't hit anyone "hard enough" yet and no one cares about emotional or mental terrorism.

My only solution is not leaving my room and going without food or the bathroom but I don't wanna live like that and it's not fair.

My grandma has already told me she's just waiting to die and she's given up on my mom so what do I do? How do I survive this? Do I even have any options?

Sometimes I feel powerless in this world.
I'm young. Like, under the age of 20 young. My voice is small and tiny, and nobody really cares. People disregard me because I'm just a dumb teenager.

Sometimes, I wish I could make a difference. That I was super strong or could move things with my mind or blast fire out of my palms so that I could lead and be strong and cool and stop fascism and capitalism.

Other times I wish I had a powerful weapon, like a powered suit of armor, that I could use.

But I'm just a teen who's sorta good at math and is really good at wowing the crowds at karaoke. I'll never be a leader. I'll never make a difference. I'll support others, I'll help a little, but... I want to change things for the better.

Y'all know what I mean? You get me?

I feel powerless. I feel blind
Its said that the last of human freedoms is the ability to choose a response based on stimulus. In my case, my senses dont give me the correct stimulus, and I have zero confidence in my ability to perceive the world around me or the situations I find myself in. Can I truly ever fix myself if I'm like this. I feel like I have no control over what happens. I feel weak. I'm so so alone. And yet I also feel I'd burden anyone willing to help anyways and that I'm so obviously not worth the effort. I feel like I'm at the bottom of a bottomless pit. I dont know what to do.....

Feeling powerless
Do anyone with social anxiety feel powerless around work bullies. I'm trying to speak up and speak out more but anxiety always holds me back especially since I am now 30. I'm supposed to stand up for myself

Sometimes I feel powerless.
How many times can I say I'll be there for you but still not feel like you want me there.

If it wasn't for you I'd probably be dead by now. I was planning on taking my life about a couple of weeks after you started working with me.. You took me out of the darkness just by being yourself....

It hurts me when I see you being hurt and being so hard on yourself and I just can't seem to help you through it.

It makes me feel like I failed you. It makes me feel like I didn't deserve to be here with you.

I feel like I don't deserve to call you my best friend.

I feel powerless and not under control
Hey

I've been trying to lose 40pounds for months now but I just can't do it. In fact I struggle to even be a single day without at least cheating a little.

When I'm hungry or have the idea of eating let's say fried chicken, I've these binge thoughts on an endless loop in my head every minute of my day. Eventually I just give in and go order my fried chicken like a zombie and eat the whole thing. Then I feel like shit, promise that ''tomorrow'' or ''monday'' ill start for real and ill lose all of it but of couse it never happens. I think about weight loss all the time Im haunted by this stuff but I just can't do it. I honestly don't feel like I even have control of this, I almost feel possessed when I go out to buy a family size chips and eat the whole thing in 30 minutes.

Maybe im just weak willed or whatever but honestly saying that doesn't do anything for me.

Anyway, I need advice because I clearly am incapable of just ''overcome it bro''

I feel powerless
Team Composition
My heroes have high power, but I think I can't use the power.

I can reset all the heroes I have.

I hate feeling powerless
34 years. There were times when I felt powerless. The first time was during my first year of college. I was failing several classes because I spent too much time learning programming. 10 years later, I made my first millions in software. But at the time when I was learning it, it was one of the dark times in my life. I moved to a new country 9 years ago and had tough times when I break up from relationships or setbacks in my career. I hated that feeling. Sometimes I was too proud to ask for support. This year, I am going through divorce. The process is easy because of mutual agreement. I tried staying active: hanging out with friends, dancing and swimming. I am taking scuba diving lessons and also started working on a pretty important project. I am having a bit problem striking a balance among these things, so I didn‚Äôt go swimming for two weeks. I started feeling a bit stressed today and I wasn‚Äôt able to go to work. I needed one day to clear my mind. I feel sometimes I set the expectation too high for myself. That strikes back at me. How can I get really good at managing stress? I always try to look strong and be the go to person when anyone needs a shoulder. I wish I don‚Äôt need support but I guess I do!

I feel powerless and fearful. I see no solution. I don‚Äôt know how to get help.

I fucking hate being fat but I feel powerless to do anything about it.
I get sad every morning when I look in the mirror. I used to be in okay shape, but got really depressed after graduating college and gained a lot of weight at this point I'm about 100 lbs over weight.

I know how to lose weight‚ÄîCICO. But o can't see to stick to eating at even a small deficit long enough to even lose a few lbs.

I've tried a million times, but I always revert back to my bad eating habits. Losing weight seems impossible for me, I hate it. I hate how I look and feel.

I feel powerless like I dont matter
Everyday I keep hope. I keep believing but everyday when nothing gets better I get scared. I look around at the loneliness. I look around at my desire to connect with compassionate people but I find no one.... The more my life isnt the way i want it to be the more I remember the attack. Yes I was raped... And I hate admitting it..... But it affects me most days.... That's why I have been numb and isolate myself... I don't have any desire to be close to anyone.... I love myself and know it wasnt my fault just my innocent nature being used against me. But I feel like i am being raped over and over again... Because rape is not something wanted to happen or expected in my life... It makes me feel unsafe and if that unwanted act took place anything can take place so better not even try..... I feel utterly defeated helpless and like everyone gets to choose their life except me.
