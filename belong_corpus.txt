From Twitter with ‘feel like an alien’:

I am unable to make friends in my new school.

Because then I would not fit in and feel lonely.

Because feeling not fitting in would mean that they will maybe bully me. 


Right now I feel like an alien
Like I'm sitting in a state of perpetual frustration


hate having social anxiety (& being antisocial altogether) cause idk how to communicate with people normally?? like i wanna be friends but i feel like an alien on earth trying to figure out how humans work & how not to be awkward


They really are. I feel like an alien on a very hostile planet most days!


When you start evolving you'll really feel like an alien in this matrix ..like you'll finally understand exactly why you never fit in, you were never meant to


I'm lost like an alien from another planet and kidnaped on the earth,I feel like I can't go back home,I wanna feel peaceful,I wanna feel better❤️


I'm literally like the most awkward person in the world when I'm commissioning someone, I deadass feel like an alien communicating through google translate


”Right now I feel like I'm an alien,
I'm so fucking dangerous,
Cover up the evidence with medicine”
I feel like an alien every day of my life


I dont feel human I feel like an alien impersonating human.


feel like an alien in my skin and in my community,


until you realize the inevitability of feeling misunderstood by everyone you meet. I feel like an alien.
