No man or woman could love me if he or she really knew me.


I am inherently flawed and defective. I am unworthy of love.


It was my fault that my parents could not love me


I hide the real me. The real me is unacceptable. The self I show is a false self.


I live with a great deal of shame about myself


One of my greatest fears is that my faults will be exposed.

From Twitter with ‚ÄòNobody wants me‚Äô:
God, I'm so lonely. Nobody wants to talk to me. 


So I‚Äôm guessing nobody wants to pop out with me.


And still nobody wants me

I don't know why I should be so hideously gloomy, but I have that miserable "nobody-loves-me" feeling.


I need reassurance because my anxiety pretty much tells me 24/7 that nobody loves me & nobody cares. Even when I know it‚Äôs not true it‚Äôs still a fight to keep from believing it.


Sometimes I feel like nobody loves me. Sometimes I feel like I don't like anyone.

Nobody loves me because im ugly.

I am afraid that people will find out that I cant do anything.

Because it makes me afraid to be real with people.

That would expose who I really am. So better to fake so that people will not see who I really am.


It's the weekend...I've got no girl to take out...nobody loves me...nobody cares...even when I say I'll marry them...might as well give up‚Ä¶

Goodnight, a terrible day even worse than the previous ones, nobody loves me as usual though.


nobody loves me, nobody appreciates me, nobody even asks about me


Just found out nobody loves me


Love is a lie. If you tell someone you love them that‚Äôs permanent.  Y‚Äôall like the idea of me you don‚Äôt love me.  Nobody loves me


Nobody misses me.
