Nobody will protect me

I think the world is against me.

Because I feel unsafe. I am afraid to step out of the house.

Because the government have people that will kill me because I am crazy.

I literally cant open up to anyone anymore. And not even to my bffs. Feels like i dont feel safe enough to say what i think.

I believe this world is evil and that people canâ€™t be trusted.

Because it makes me feel frightened. How will I be able to trust people.

It makes me feel like no one knows except me.

I feel so small in this worldðŸ˜­ there is so much evil man, it makes me sick


sometimes I feel like I'm just blindly believing everything I read about china on the internet, I have no way of verifying any of these claims, but if even 10% of it is true they've gotta be pound-for-pound the most evil country in the world


The world is so evil. Makes me feel like I truly donâ€™t belong. My heart is too pure


Me personally itâ€™s TO MANY CRAZY PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD. Until I feel like itâ€™s OKAY and safe my child we not be round NO bitch that my bd messes with. This shit is REAL like thereâ€™s really evil people in this world. That lady is a MOTHER yâ€™all will never know how that shit feel


I canâ€™t help but the feel that the world is evil


I just feel world getting a darker place. Every now and then I get nosy and start researching something and sometimes it takes me down a dark path, there is real evil controlling humanity. I know I shouldnt look as it just feeds negativity and markks podcasts takes it away again


Little child
Dry your crying eyes
How can I explain
The fear you feel inside
Â´cause you were born
Into this evil world
Where man is killing man
and no one knows just why


Hell is empty, the devil is in the world, the evil of human nature is constantly refreshing the bottom line, the older I grow up, the more I feel that some people's conscience was eaten by dogs, it is true.


When i was younger my mom used to tell me that when i was sad it was because the evil people in the world were mad at my happiness. And that i should just keep living because in the end they dont matter.


is the not that has to suffer from this... it hurts me knowing thereâ€™s people in the world that are so cruel, evil and disgusting ... why? Thatâ€™s all we question now.. why them? Why her? Why him?
i feel like judgement day is just around the corner man.. thereâ€™s alot of evil in this world i canâ€™t even comprehend 


The world is an awful place. 
It really feels like there's a battle between good and evil and that good is losing. 
I'm not even talking about the politics of right now.
It feels like for every good news story there's 2 horrifying stories.
It just feels like bad times right now.


....Animal farming is the most destructive force the planet has ever known. 


The animal holocaust is the longest living holocaust in the history of the world.


I truely feel every single day like Iâ€™m walking around in Nazi Germany & no one realized how evil everyone is.


Yes it is my choice to feel this way, and my freedom. But why am I the source of darkness? More evil, more murder, more destruction and more rape and underage sexual assault has been done in the name of god or hiding behind god than anything else in the world, look in a mirror.


This is a cruel world with some evil systems man. Cruel fucking world. I knew something just felt weird about us celebrating her going to prison. They never get the time deserved. This bothers me so much man. How do you not feel something about this decision. We shouldnâ€™t be numb


I wish that news is true. It means we are finally able to compete with the most powerful country of the world. And we are no longer a blindly tolerant one.
Now you can experience what Chinese feel when your government subsidize these armed rebels and evil cults against China.
