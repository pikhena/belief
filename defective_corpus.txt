When your boyfriends friend walks into the apartment and sees you fully naked. I wanna die #embarrassed

All my relationships are ruined by me because I am too much for the other half.

It is bad because I am a terrible person for them. I always mess up.

Because I really want someone to love me for the way I am. But I think I am a loser.

My life is a mess right now. I don’t accomplish anything. I am so lazy.

Because I fail at everything in life.

I think I am going to die early in life.

Because I am so clumsy.

Because I only damage the world around me and other people. That makes me feel bad and I feel hurt too.
