Twitter:

I feel invisible

So guys, I think I'm gonna make my monster sona invisible. Probably because I don't just have a fascination for those monsters of the Unknown, but I feel like it would reflect me personally. I always felt invisible to the world, non existing essentially.

after being made to feel so utterly invisible, after enduring that loud silence from my peers, after getting my crying out afterwards, i used the rage i had (and still have, to this day) to pledge something to myself: i will not be invisible. i will make myself INESCAPABLE.

Lost in a crowd of a thousand faces. 

That's how i feel right at this very moment. 

Lost.

It's like im #Invisible.

I'd like to chat about mental health and invisible illnesses again tomorrowðŸ˜Š
If you suffer from or know anyone who suffers from any of these.. please come and share your story,or feel free to open up (even in a whisper) and let's talk about it.
Its lonely going through it alone.

I constantly feel so invisible as a black woman both romantically and in general Iâ€™m so tired of being treated like a stepping stone

i always ignored, I feel invisible and it breaks my heart

I am so depressed about animal slaughter right now. I feel so helpless to stop any of it. I know I advocate for animal rights a lot, but itâ€™s not enough. I canâ€™t sleep knowing while I rest, animals are being brutally murdered. It doesnâ€™t feel right. I feel so lost & broken rn.

am i not good enough?

Yes, I cry a lot in bed. But no, not because of boys and love. Mostly because of money, my mom, friends, studies and why the hell am I not good enough...a thread

am i the only one that feels like thereâ€™s not enough hours throughout the day?

is it just me or does it frustrate u a lot when u finally open up abt ur problems to someone and they just make it feel so insignificant and that it is easily brushed off? No wonder I don't rant or say anything bc I am tired of this mentality

Iâ€™m done with anyone putting me down. I KNOW who I am as a human being & my intentions. I donâ€™t care who you are, if you constantly downing/ belittling me, trying to make me feel insignificant & worthless. You simply will no longer be a part of my life.

Wow I put my playlist on to avoid this and it has spiralled out of control. RIP  my productivity, Iâ€™m thinking about how insignificant I am

I feel so small and insignificant.  I am actually in frame.

Yk sometimes I feel like nobody cares about me,nobody cares if I'm alive nobody cares if I'm unset happy of cry literally dont even deserve to exist even tweeting this I just know nobody cares my life is literally pointless, I try not to feel this way and be happy but it's hard

I felt so empty 
Nowhere to go 
I felt unloved 
I felt alone 
I felt nobody
I felt worthless 
I feel like I dont exist 
Pagud na ako .
Feels like no way out of depression

some days im just so TIRED of like, having to operate this human body. and i feel like i dont even actually exist like i know that i am here. but i am also Not Anywhere. like i don't exist on this physical plane so i am actually just Not Here but also Everywhere Else too.

i also like that this account is public. iâ€™m staying under the radar on the other one because i consider myself new so i feel like i dont exist there

i feel like im dreaming but i know im awake?? its such a strange feeling... i don't feel like myself.. i feel like an actor acting as myself? i dont feel real. i dont exist right now and its kind of worrying me..

I feel like im worth nothing.
Maybe for my mom u know. But i could maybe just die and twenty people would give a fuck about it for a year and then its nothing

i feel purposeless/empty/worthless and i have no personality or friends i have nothing no skills. Im pathetic and sad. No one likes me. Im sooo boring. How do i stop chasing others approval/attention? How do i being a boring/bland nice guy??
I wonder every day why we do the things we do.. who am i, what im supposed to do. Im stuck to porn and girls online tho. My misrable life. I feel so stupid.

I want to chock my self to death. And end this misery. I always got nothing to say. When people ask me questions im not fun! I just answer with long sentences.. but after i get home i think about what i should have said! Why is that!? Im obssessed with trying to make people to like me im obssessed with porn and women im obsseesed with people that dont even like me. No one loves me, im important to no one. Im a piece of garbage in this world. I have nothing to talk about with anyone and so do people. I put everyone on pedestal mostly girls. Its like im everyones sidekick...no one takes me seriously im boring in convos ask questions like interviews etc...

I worry so fucking much about people online that i talk to. They arent one bit intrested..its like i want to prove my self. I reflect every reply from girls to my self. They just give one words its a hint they dont care. I cant discuss anything at all.

How do i get better at talking to people? I run out of things to say. And i always think i bore other person..

Im stressed out and dont really know what to do to fix this... whats my biggest problem? Am i doing the wrong thing by trying to make friends online? Sometimes porn releases my stress and i think clearly.

People give me the vibe that i never deserve thier attention or respect.. And im so.worried about getting love or GF or women too... idk how to stop it. Everyone is too good for me. Everyone is smarter than me cooler and funnier. Idk my real identity. Who am i supposed to be in this world.. i try really hard to impress people. Idk who i am. Idk who is the real me. I think there is not even real me cause no personality. Im impossible to be liked. And i always chase women. They never chase me... idk what i want. Everyone is perfect but not me.. im not easy to get along with..i will be friends with whoever is willing to be my friend.. but no one wants to be friends with me.

What do i talk about with people anyways?? I feel like ppl are too good to have a conversation with me and they make me feel me that way too..

I have no banter with anyone.. i always tell name jokes and i get offended easily. My jokes are very rude also but not funny at all. Im so fucking angry. Im angry at everything mostly my self. Im angry that im nothing. Im angry idk how to change. I want to give up on life. Idk whats life about. But i want to end my life.

Sometimes boys ignore girls and girls think about him all day but me ? They dont give a flying crap. Why would they care? Im so forgetable. Im not cool. I suck at convos. All i say is "so uhh, ummm, what u doing" then nothing

If i talk to someone it goes fine im worried about what to say next time i see them. Most times i just say nothing or something they wont care about. Mostly happens with girls online.

Sometimes i talk to girls online first its really good then it goes no where but down from that.. i get boring/bland.. no more questions or talks... i start too strong then i have to put on a show.. its like a test.. that i try really hard to make them like me.. its like im their entertainer...its like i always have to be funny to keep them even interested.. and im jealous of people who are funny in groups im never the funny one. No one is interested in me. Im invinsible.. its like i dont have enough material for anyone.. im very blunt too. Im not fun at all. Im nothing im nobody.

And my convos are always uncomfortable and idk what to talk about i dont get along with anyone. Its always "how is it going" or "what you doing" then convo finishes.. so awkward and bland and boring...im so uninteresting.. i have nothing to say to anybody. Im out of conversation. All my talks are open ended. Im really stressed out by texting girls online and not getting a single reply.. in where i live dating isnt allowed so i have to text girls even only for wanting be friends...i never talked to a women before face to face.. i wouldnt know what im supposed to say, at that time my mind would be empty and dont know what to start with... i never have had a best friend.. Im literally a man-child... i dont feel like doing anything at all.. but my mind is complex af right now. Idk what i am thiking or why im thinking these. I keep comparing my self to superheros in movies. How they are perfect and i am... I mean im so low and such a loser that i dont even know how to talk..... im awkward around girls too... im generally confused about women, men, life, religion, family, everything.. i hate everyone and everything too. I never put my mind to anything worthwhile

Sometimes i think i have meant to be a loser for my entire life. I want to change it but idk how. I want to be cool smart funny intelligent assertive with sense of humour i want friends close ones too. I want a GF too.. but i will never achive a thing like this. I dont even have comebacks to any insult.

I tell things that everyone knows. I dont have my own opinions or thoughts or even ideas. I cant even come up with a joke or insult or comeback. Im nothing. My mind is empty... people talk for hours i cant even talk for a few secs. Idk how to start convos maybe its just online chat that sucks the blood out of me. I cant even do a small talk.

Idk how to ask questions about peoples interests... they tell what they are interested in it and i just say "cool" or thats interesting.. my convos are so dumb and dull and boring.. i cant attract beautiful intelligent women either. Im the worst human being in this earth by definition.

Movies or tv shows make me sad cause ppl in there are.super cool super smart and rich and im a loser.

I feel like im not worthy getting any women.. i feel like every girl is cooler than me. Feeling they are cooler than me.

How my convos should be like ? Getting to know each other?? Who am i ? What do i do to make friends? Am a really sarcastic guy? Or a bland/boring guy? Who should i be when talking to others? How do i make people close to me? Maybe i should focus less on making friends online. Im worried so much about this.. im worried about what to say next. What do couples talk about everyday and never run out of things to talk about?? My questions are boring as hell. I just get yes or no answers... my convos are always generic.. i send 100 girls messages and i still dont get replied..am i just desperate or what. No one wants to hangout with me. Im so bad at everything. I feel like i dont exist. Im nobody. Everyone ignores me. Its like i want to be popular real bad just like my friends..idk how to stop trying

My family always calls me a loser.. a man with no plans or future or skills. Im so lame. Im so annoying too. No one likes me. Im a nonsense and my talks are nonsense too. No wonder any cute girl would never put any effort in me. Its because i dont deserve it. I have nothing to offer. I have no personality. Im dumb. I never fit in..

And people get to me sometimes so easily. Im not really tough or assertive or a bastard that pushes away those who are mean to him.

In texting while trying so much to make girls like me or value me or at least just say hello to me i try a lot and i turn out to be weird or boring or my talks are absolute nonsense... i dont know how to talk. Idk anything.

How some guys text so little to girls and girls still be interested in them? I dont have that superpower. Im not fun or cool. Am a total loser with a retarded mindset and tottaly boring/bland. Im not a badass or cool kid or a guy that people take seriously. Im invisible and no one really respects me.

I always put more effort in than others.. but no one puts any effort into me. What do i do to make people like me???

But my convos are always dry or boring or bland or i run out of interesting questions to ask.. i ask questions like an interview and most times just get a Yes or no.. no one cares about me or loves me or thinks im important.. im just a stupid invisible boring nice guy..

Idk how to be interested in people, idk how to make friends...im not even interested in my self. I hate my self..

Idk who i am, idk how to realize who i am, idk how to find out who i want to be? Some role model? Like who? James bond?

What are convos suppose to be like? In real life and online??

I try really hard to make people laugh. It happens when i see someone being funny.. so i try to say something funny too. It turns out bad...

I have spent so much of my life trying to be noticed/valued/heard.. and trying to get people to give me attention.. there is so much anger inside my towards my self and everything around me..

Im always one to text first guess im really needy and chase others approval and please people just to be my friend.. this is pathetic and idk how to fix it..

Im not the one who people love Im not the one that people chase I have no skills Im not anyones best friend I dont get invited to anything I dont have friends irl or a GF. I have no job either.. Im not loved by anyone, not important for anyone.. Im only nice or rude. Which both are dumb and arent really a quality. But being rude is better than being nice to girls...idk who to be.

I only play soccer watch movies and listen to music. These are the 3 things i do nothing more...

Im not creative or funny or intelligent or charming or cool or smart or confindent or charismatic like James bond.. im worthless and i have no qualities at all..i have no personality im like a robot..i have no humour or no orginality in me. Im too typical and so none orginal sooo generic. I have no ideas or thoughts or opinions on my own. Im not smart enough to create opinions or big ideas. Im not even smart enough to create a joke. I have no clinical thinking..im not good to anything.

Im basically like a servent when i talk to girls.. and i can be fooled so easily.. i cant fool people either.. even for fun.. because im like a joke to people.. maybe im just mean.. maybe i have a really big ego.. i have really passive aggressive jokes too.. idk how to get to know people, i dont know how to know people..

Im jealous of people with a lot of friends.. and jealous of those who have banter with each other or calling each other nicknames.. im invisible..

I try really hard to make friends online its like i want people to fill the hole of emptiness inside me..all i been thinking about is getting a GF. Not sure if i want it but i feel like it will fix all my problems.. do i even have problems? Idk..

Im addicted to porn i can escape but then i havs nothing to do and idk what to do to self improvement..

Im jealous of people who got girls chasing them and girls interested in them, jealous of ppl who get attention.. like i used to be worried about likes and rts...

I cant even win a fucking arguement im so brainless. I hate my self with passion. People love themselfs for 50 reasons but for me there is no reason.

What do i do with my life? Whats my biggest problem? Do i even have a problem? Am i alright? Am i good? Or is it my brain trying to fake it? Whats the purpose of living? Self improvment? And having friends ? Finding interests? Being kind to everyone? How do be more wise and have a wider view on life? Maybe i already have? I just need to not to give up ? Do i need to watch tv shows that are funny and help me with confidence? Is this good? How do i stop people pleasing? How do i make people like me/value me? How do i never run out of things to say? How do i stop having boring convos that are like interviews? How do i be smart and think more clearly? And have good ideas and thoughts? Im a moron. I have lame jokes lame convos. How do i be interested in others? Im always about "getting" not "giving" how do i like others? How do i know what qualities they have? How do i have friends?

If i say i need nobody isnt it arrogant?

Whats my biggest problem? What are my problems? How do i self improvment? How do i unluck my true potentional? Im getting fucking mad/bitter for not knowing. Im mad for being a loser. I DONT HAVE ANYTHING. Im low/bored/depressed. Im not anyones type. Im not worth of anyone. Im a person who cant have a normal convo. The odds of a hot girl liking me are 0. My convos are tedious its like im forcing other person to talk. Mostly girls online.

I feel hopeless. I don't have a direction. I feel invisible by society. I suffer from physical pain.
Rant
I don't know what to do about this, it feels like I am trapped in this miserable cycle where we must be corporate slaves for some decades, then spend our final years screaming in pain. It's a shitty place to live tbh.

There are copes in life, but only to detach ourselves from this miserable reality. And these copes and pleasures are finite, while the sickness and diseases are for eternity. They won't disappear.

I feel invisible
Serious
Honestly. No person of the opposite sex ever talks to me, looks my way, makes a move on me, anything. Other guys talk to me for the sole purpose of annoying me and pissing me off. I honestly donâ€™t care anymore. Why do some people get noticed right away? What is wrong with me? Am i ugly, or weird, or something? I canâ€™t tell and it sucks.

I feel invisible sometimes.
I really like MGTOW philosophy and the way of life but today I happened to strike up a conversation with a girl and we hit it off. Later i saw her dancing all over and gettin it on with other dudes at the club.

Iâ€™m not angry or mad at her at all. It just kinda made me feel like I donâ€™t matter at all to her. It felt like Iâ€™m not good enough. I donâ€™t know what to do if anything. Just not my greatest day :(

I feel invisible
I keep trying to make enough noise to be heard. I make stuff, I say stuff, I do stuff. But as far as acknowledgement that I exist; I get pained smiles and "thats neat", with an immediate change of conversation. The same smiles, replies, and change of topic I have gotten since I was 9 years old. I could disappear into thin air and my funeral would be people smiling and saying "thats neat" to each other.
