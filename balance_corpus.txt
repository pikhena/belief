I am unbalanced


I am out of control


I can’t be moderate


I always get it wrong


Nothing works for me


I stuff up everything I do


I am a klutz


I can’t fix it

Everything I do goes wrong


I attract trouble


I have ruined my whole life


I can’t get it right


I am in the wrong place


I can’t make it work (klutz)


I can’t fix it


I will never be able to fix it up


Supporting beliefs and predictions


Other people have to fix my life for me
